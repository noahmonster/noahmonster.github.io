<h2>Black Bread</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<UL><b>A</b>
	<LI>2 cups warm water + 2 tsp instant coffee powder (optional)
	<LI>4 Tbs brown sugar
	<LI>&frac14; cup vinegar
	<LI>4 Tbs unsweetened cocoa powder
	<LI>&frac12; tsp anise seed
	<LI>2 tsp salt
	<LI>2 Tbs caraway seed
	<LI>1 pkg (2 tsp) yeast
</UL>

<UL><b>B</b>
	<LI>2 cups rye flour
	<LI>&frac34; cup bran
	<LI>&frac12; cup whole wheat flour
</UL>

<UL><b>C</b>
	<LI>~ 3 cups white flour
</UL>

<h3>Method</h3>

<p>Mix A together.  Mix in B.  Knead in C to form stiff dough.  Cover with damp towel.  Rise in a warm place until nearly doubled (this is a heavy loaf that won't rise as much as most breads).  Divide into two, fold into loaves.  Place loaves on lightly greased sheet (or sheet covered with parchment paper), cover with damp towel, and rise till nearly doubled.  Bake @ 375&deg; ~ 30-40 minutes.  Rap on bottom &mdash;  if not hollow sounding, put loaf back for another 5 min, or more.
