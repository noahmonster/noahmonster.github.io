<h4>How to Make a Flour Gravy</h4>

<p>The basic recipe for gravy is 2 Tbs flour to 1 cup stock.  Stir-fried onions, carrots, celery, plus salt, pepper, and ground thyme can also be added.

<p>The trick to making gravy is to disperse the flour into cool liquid so that it doesn't form lumps.  This can be done with oil, or carefully without oil.

<p>Oil method:  Add flour to pan.  Add enough oil to make a thin paste &mdash; this surrounds each flour particle to prevent clumping.  Add the liquid with constant stirring, and heat over medium heat until thickened.  Cover and reduce heat to the minimum for thorough cooking.

<p>Oil-free method:  Add flour to pan.  Add just enough cool liquid, stirring to make a thick batter.  Keep stirring until all lumps are gone. Work in the rest of the liquid, a little at a time.  Cook as above.
