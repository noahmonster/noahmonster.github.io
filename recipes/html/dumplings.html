<h2>Dumplings</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<UL><b>A</b>
	<LI>2 cups flour
	<LI>&frac14; tsp salt
	<LI>1 Tbs baking powder
</UL>

<UL><b>B</b>
	<LI>4 Tbs (&frac14; cup) oil
</UL>

<UL><b>C</b>
	<LI>3/4 cup milk
</UL>



<h3>Method</h3>

<p>Sift A together.  Add B and work in with clean hands, grinding the clumps of oil between your fingers until uniformly distributed.

<p>Stir in C to make a soft dough.  Gather up blobs of the dough in a mixing spoon and push them off onto the top of a simmering meal with another spoon.  Cover and simmer for 20 minutes.  Do not open during cooking as the dumplings are being cooked by the steam.
