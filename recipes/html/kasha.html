<h2>Kasha</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>


<UL><b>A</b>
	<LI>1 cup Wolf's kasha (buckwheat groats), either medium or coarse
	<LI>1 egg
</UL>

<UL><b>B</b>
	<LI>&frac12; onion, chopped (optional)
</UL>

<UL><b>C</b>
	<LI>1 &frac34; cup water, or 2 cups stock
</UL>


<h3>Method</h3>

<p><B>Note:</B> the trick to making kasha is to have the grain hot enough, and to add <B>boiling</B> stock to it.  If you don't do this the kasha will be mushy.

<p>Fork-beat the egg, then mix into kasha until coated.  (You can omit the egg &mdash; see below.)

<p>If using B, stir-fry until translucent.  Use a heavy saucepan with a tight lid.  

<p>Lower heat to medium and add A.  Continue stir-frying until the grains are all dry and separate.  If you've omitted the egg, you want to toast the grains until they're hot to the touch, stirring or tossing often to avoid burning them.  Meanwhile, heat C in a microwave for about 3 minutes until boiling.

<p>Pour boiling C into the pot, cover and set heat to very low.  <B>Note:</B> expect a vigorous reaction when the boiling liquid is added to the hot pot &mdash; do it fast and get the pot covered.

<p>Turn off heat after 15 minutes and allow to rest another 5.
