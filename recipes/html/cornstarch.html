<h4>How to Thicken With Cornstarch</h4>


<p>Cornstarch is a quick thickener for stews, but must be added properly.  If you just dump it in dry you will wind up with big gummy lumps.

<p>Put the cornstarch in a glass or bowl and add &frac14;-&frac12; cup cold water while stirring, until it is completely lump free and looks like milk.  Stir this into the hot stew and continue stirring until it thickens.
