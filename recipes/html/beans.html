<h4>How to Cook Beans</h4>


<p><b>Note</b>: canned beans are cheap, and will work for most of these recipes (not the soups).  Canned beans tend to be mushy, and have too much liquid &mdash; pour it off and reserve it in case you want to add it back.

<p>To cook dried beans, first go over them <b>very</b> carefully to remove rocks and mudballs, which can ruin an entire meal.  Pouring the beans into a white pan or baking sheet, a small amount at a time, works well.

<p>Soak the beans overnight in a large amount of water.  Split peas need only a few hours, and lentils only an hour.

<p>Drain the old water and just cover the beans with fresh water (at least twice as much water for soups).

<p>Bring the pot to a boil, then turn down heat, cover, and simmer 1-3 hours until tender but not mushy.  Stir occasionally.  Cooking time varies because of bean size and age.  Lentils cook in about 30 minutes, split peas in 1-1 &frac12; hours.  Soups can be overcooked, as you generally want the beans to be soft.
