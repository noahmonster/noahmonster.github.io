<h2>Macaroni and Cheese</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<UL><b>A</b>
	<LI>8 oz (2 cups) macaroni
</UL>

<UL><b>B</b>
	<LI>6 Tbs flour
	<LI>2 &frac12; cups milk
	<LI>1 tsp mustard
	<LI>pepper
</UL>

<UL><b>C</b>
	<LI>4 oz sharp cheddar, cubed
	<LI>4 oz sharp cheddar, sliced
</UL>

<UL><b>D</b>
	<LI>Tomato slices (optional)
</UL>


<h3>Method</h3>

<p>Boil A until firm but not hard.  Drain.  

<p>Make sauce from B:  Stir a little milk into flour and spices to make a paste &mdash; keep adding milk until you can dump it all in without making lumps.  Cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly to avoid scorching bottom.  When thickened, remove 1 &frac14; cup. This will be mixed into the macaroni. What's left in the pot will be the topping:  add the sliced cheese and allow to heat slowly to melt.

<p>Pour the removed 1 &frac14; cup sauce onto the macaroni, add the cubed cheese, and stir.  Pour into the casserole dish.

<p>Stir the pot of cheese topping until the cheese is completely dissolved.  Pour onto the macaroni casserole.

<p>Bake covered 25 minutes @ 325&deg;.  Uncover and bake another 15-20 minutes until bubbly and lightly browned across the top.
