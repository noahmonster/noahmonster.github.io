<h2>Sourdough Potato Rolls</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<UL><b>A</b>
	<LI>2 medium potatoes, cooked and mashed
	<LI>1 tsp yeast
	<LI>1&frac12; cup water
	<LI>1 cup flour
</UL>

<UL><b>B</b>
	<LI>1 cups whole wheat flour
        <LI>1 egg
	<LI>2 Tbs sugar
	<LI>&frac12; cup milk
	<LI>1 Tbs salt
        <LI>1 tsp yeast
	<LI>3-4 cups flour
</UL>



<h3>Method</h3>

<p>Mix A together, stirring vigorously for 100 strokes.  Cover loosely and allow to ferment for 12-36 hours.

<p>Combine A and B to make a soft dough and knead.  Cover with moist towel and allow to rise double in the proverbial warm place.

<p>Roll the dough out into a long rope and divide into 12-24 pieces.  Hand form each into a roll, and place on either a baking sheet or (preferably) a sheet of parchment paper.  Cover with moist towel and allow to rise double in that warm place.

<p>Slide the parchment sheet onto the stones of a 400&deg; oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, depending on size.
