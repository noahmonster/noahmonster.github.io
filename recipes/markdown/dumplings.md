# Dumplings
## Ingredients

### A
* 2 cups flour
* ¼ tsp salt
* 1 Tbs baking powder 

### B
* 4 Tbs (¼ cup) oil 

### C
* 3/4 cup milk 

## Method

Sift A together. Add B and work in with clean hands, grinding the clumps of oil between your fingers until uniformly distributed.

Stir in C to make a soft dough. Gather up blobs of the dough in a mixing spoon and push them off onto the top of a simmering meal with another spoon. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Do not open during cooking as the dumplings are being cooked by the steam.
