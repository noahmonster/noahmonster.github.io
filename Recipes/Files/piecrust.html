<h2>&frac12; Flaky Pie Crust</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<UL><b>A</b>
	<LI>1 &frac14; cups flour
	<LI>&frac12; tsp salt
</UL>

<UL><b>B</b>
	<LI>8 Tbs (1 stick) butter, cut into &frac14;-inch chunks.  Keep cold, almost frozen
	<LI>5 Tbs; cup ice water
</UL>




<h3>Method</h3>

<p> <b>NOTE:</b>  The object is to have the butter remain in the crust as solid chunks, not melt into the flour. </p>

<p>Pulse the butter, flour, and salt in a food processor until the mixture resembles coarse sand, with some small lumps of butter (no larger than pea-sized) remaining. This will probably take 15 to 20 (-second) pulses. 

<p>Feed one tablespoon of ice water at a time through the feed tube, pulsing 4 to 5 times after each addition. Stop adding water when the mixture begins to form large clumps and pulls away from sides of the bowl.

<p>Dump the mixture onto a work surface and push it together into a big lump using your hands.  Form into a ball and flatten into a 4-inch disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour. 

<p>Remove the dough from the refrigerator 3 to 4 minutes ahead of time so that it just starts to soften and is easier to roll. Roll out the disk of dough from the center moving outward, turning it a quarter turn and repeating until the diameter of the whole crust is about 4 inches larger than the pie pan. Once the crust is rolled out, allow it to rest for 5 minutes.

<p>Carefully transfer the pie crust to the pie pan, flute the edges, and proceed with your pie recipe as directed.
