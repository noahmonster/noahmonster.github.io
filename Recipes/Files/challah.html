<h2>Challah</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<UL>
	<LI>4-5 cups unbleached or bread flour
	<LI>1 pkg (2 tsp) yeast
	<LI>3 eggs
	<LI>&frac14; cup sugar
	<LI>&frac14; cup oil		
	<LI>2 tsp salt
	<LI>1 cup warm water
</UL>

<h3>Optional Glaze</h3>

<UL>
	<LI>&frac12; tsp cornstarch in &frac12; cup water, microwave to thicken
</UL>



<h3>Method</h3>

<p>Mix together.  Knead, rise until doubled.  

<p>Divide dough into three (standard) or four (top challah) even amounts. Roll into snakes about 2 feet long.  Widely braid the three snakes on a sheet of parchment.  For top challah, divide the remaining snake into three and roll out each one.  Braid these into a long, narrow challah and glue it on top of the main challah with water or the glaze.  Cover with a moist towel and rise again.

<p>Brush the challah gently with the glaze, then bake @ 375&deg;s about 20 min. Brush again with glaze after removing from the oven.
