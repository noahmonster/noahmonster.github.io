<h3>Method</h3>

<p><b>Note: </b>This is an infinitely variable recipe.  Use whatever ingredients you'd like.  The filling can be stir-fried or microwaved.  The completed recipe can be heated in the microwave or oven.

<p>Cut a cone-shaped hole in the bottom of the cabbage to free the leaves.  Put the cabbage in a large pot of boiling water to parboil and release the leaves.  As the leaves soften, release them one-by-one by slipping a large spoon (a slotted spoon works well) under them and prying off.  Remove leaves to a plate and then to the refrigerator.

<p>Prepare the filling by microwaving or stir-frying B 5-10 minutes until the carrots have softened but still have some bite.  Add C for another 5-10 minutes.  Add D and half of E and continue another 5 minutes until thoroughly heated (160&deg;F if you have a thermometer).  Add salt, pepper, soy sauce, etc. to taste.  Chill.

<p>Fill each leaf with a scoop of filling, fold in the ends and roll up.  Tie with cotton kitchen string.  Layer in a small casserole dish, then cover with remaining E.  When ready to serve microwave 10 minutes.
