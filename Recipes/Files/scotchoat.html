<h2>Scottish Oatmeal Bread</h2>



<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<UL><b>A</b>
	<LI>2 cups boiling water
	<LI>1 &frac12; cups Scottish (Irish) steel-cut oats
</UL>

<b>The following is for each of two batches:</b>

<UL><b>B</b>
	<LI>&frac12; A
	<LI>3/8c powdered milk
	<LI>3 Tbs brown sugar
	<LI>1/2 grated ginger chunk (walnut sized)
	<LI>2 tsp salt
	<LI>1 &frac12; tsp yeast
	<LI>&frac14; tsp cinnamon
	<LI>3-4 cups flour
</UL>

<UL><b>D</b>
	<LI>1 cup warm water
</UL>


<h3>Method</h3>

<p>Combine A and set aside to cool until lukewarm.

<p><b>Do this in two batches, then combine the batches:</b>  Combine B.  Add D while mixing.  Knead to form a soft dough, adding the 4<sup>th</sup> cup of flour as needed to prevent sticking to the bowl.  Cover with damp towel and rise till doubled, about 1 - 1 &frac12; hours.

<p>Squash down dough, divide in three, and fold into loaves.  Rise in lightly oiled pans covered with damp cloth, till doubled.

<p>Bake ~ 20 minutes @ 400&deg;.  Done when nicely browned. Pop out of pan and rap on bottom &mdash;  if not hollow sounding, put loaf directly on rack and bake another 5 min, or more.
