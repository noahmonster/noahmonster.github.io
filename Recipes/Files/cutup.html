<h4>How to Cut up a Chicken</h4>


<p>Place the chicken on a cutting board with the legs up.  Pull one leg out to the side, then cut the entire leg and thigh away from the carcass at the hip joint.  Place this piece on the cutting board and feel for the point where the two join and rotate:  cut here to separate the drumstick from the thigh.  Repeat for the other leg.

<p>In a similar manner, pull the wings out to the side and cut them away from the carcass at the joint.

<p>Cut down along each side of the center breastbone and remove the breast meat off each side.  Scrape down along the bone to remove as much meat with the breast as possible.

<p>The remaining carcass is good for making stock, but doesn't have enough meat to put into the main dish.
