<h3>Method</h3>

<p>Boil A, then cool.

<p>Remove turkey.  Truss turkey's drumsticks and wings with string.  Roast 30 minutes @ 500&deg.  Then cover breast with a triangle of foil and roast @ 350&deg;  until breast reaches 161&deg; and stuffing is at least 140&deg;. Let stand at least 15 minutes before carving.

<p>While turkey is cooking, make a stock from the giblets.  Put them in a saucepan with about 1 cup of water and a halved onion, and simmer covered for about 2 hours.  Pour off the stock and reserve.

<p>After removing turkey from the pan, pour the drippings into a jar and cool.  Later, discard any fat on top.

<p>Make a gravy by combining the pan drippings and giblet stock and following the instructions for <a href="#" onclick="window.open('gravybox.html','mywindow', 'width=290,height=400'); return false">gravy</a>.
