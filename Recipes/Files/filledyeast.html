<h2>Chocolate and Cinnamon Rolls</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<UL><b>A</b>
	<LI>2 tsp yeast
	<LI>5-5&frac12; cups flour
	<LI>1 tsp salt
	<LI>1 &frac34; cups warm milk or 5/8 cup powdered milk + 13 oz. water
	<LI>&frac34; cups sugar
	<LI>1 &frac12; tsp vanilla
</UL>

<UL><b>B</b>
	<LI>sugar
	<LI>cinnamon
	<LI>cocoa
	<LI>raisins
</UL>


<h3>Method</h3>

<p>Make a soft dough from A and rise once.  Knead again and rise again.

<p>Divide dough in two.  Roll out each as a rectangle, approximately 12" x 18".  It's important to get the sides perpendicular and parallel.

<p>Sprinkle one with 3 Tbs cocoa and 3 Tbs sugar, leaving a 1" border at all the edges.  Sprinkle the other with 3 Tbs sugar, raisins, and cinnamon.

<p>Brush the two 18" edges and one 12" edge with water.  Roll up, starting at the unbrushed 12" edge.  Try to exclude air as you roll.  Place the seam underneath for a better seal, and fold the two ends under.  If available, place the breads on parchment atop a baguette pan.  Allow the breads to rise double once again.  Bake ~ 25 minutes @ 350&deg;.
